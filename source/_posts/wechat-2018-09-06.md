### 【英文脚本】
Catherine
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Catherine.

Dan
And I'm Dan.

Catherine
Now Dan, would you say you had a sedentary lifestyle at all?

Dan
If I only went to work, yes, I would have a pretty sedentary life. I sit on the tube, I sit at my desk or in the studio for most of the day. But because I know that's not good for my health, I do also like to go to the gym a couple of times a week and I'll do some exercise, like a bike ride or playing football at the weekend. So, my job is pretty sedentary, but not my life.

Catherine
Nice answer, Dan. And our topic today is about how one country in particular has been very successful in dealing with the problem of a sedentary population. But before we find out more, here is today's question. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours? So, Dan, what do you think?

Dan
Based on my day, it would be between 8 and 9 hours, but I don't know if I am an average person! So I'm interested to learn the answer for myself.

Catherine
We'll find out the answer later in the programme. Now, 40 years ago Finland was perhaps the unhealthiest country in the Western world. But now, it's one of the healthiest.

Dan
Death by heart disease in Finland has fallen by 80% and life expectancy, the age at which the average person lives until, has risen by 10 years.

Catherine
How has this been achieved? This was investigated on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme and one of the ways Finland has improved the health of the nation is by a lot of state involvement. BBC reporter John Laurenson describes in a humorous way how this works. How does he describe someone with many health problems?

John Laurenson
If you're an exercise shirker because you're fat or old or asthmatic or chained to your computer or just plain lazy or all of those things rolled into one super-health disaster zone, they will come to you in the form perhaps, of a stern lady with a clipboard and make some firm suggestions. They won't actually drag you off your PlayStation, out of your nursing home or out of the pub but they do get quite close.

Catherine
How did he describe someone with a lot of health problems, Dan?

Dan
Well, he wasn't very complimentary, and we should emphasise that this report is quite tongue-in-cheek, which means that it's meant to be funny and shouldn't be taken seriously but he called the people with many health problems 'super-health disaster zones'.

Catherine
'Super-health disaster zones'. So what other vocabulary can we pick from what he said?

Dan
He talked about being an exercise shirker. A shirker is someone who avoids doing something usually because they are being lazy. It's also a verb, to shirk.

Catherine
Laurenson says that if you are an exercise shirker or indeed a super-health disaster zone, someone from the authorities will come and visit you. In another tongue-in-cheek description he says that this visitor might be a stern lady with a clipboard.

Dan
Stern is an adjective which means very serious and strict, someone without a sense of humour who might be quite angry. And in his description the reporter says that this stern lady will have a clipboard. It's a hard board you can attach papers to so you can write on the paper while you are moving around.

Catherine
So we have this image of an angry lady arriving at your house to tell you off for your health habits and make you live a healthier life.

Dan
But he does point out that they won't actually drag you out of your house to do exercise. However, in the report he goes on to say that there is lot of encouragement, even from school age, to eat well and take regular exercise.

Catherine
Well, before a stern lady with a clipboard comes and tells us off for not finishing on time, let's get the answer to today's quiz. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours?

Dan
And I said I had no idea.

Catherine
Well, the answer was c), Dan - between 8 and 9 hours. In fact, it was 8 and a quarter hours. By comparison, in Finland, it's less than 6 hours.

Dan
I guess we are a lot more sedentary in Britain.

Catherine
And sedentary is our first word in our vocabulary review. It's an adjective used to describe a lifestyle which involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise.

Dan
And if you are very sedentary, it can lead to a lower life expectancy. Life expectancy, the age to which you are expected to live.

Catherine
Next we had the word shirker for someone who avoids doing something they don't like, usually because they are lazy. For example, an exercise shirker avoids exercise.

Dan
Something that is said tongue-in-cheek is meant to be humorous and not taken seriously.

Catherine
If you are stern though, you want to be taken seriously. It's an adjective that means serious and strict.

Dan
And finally there's clipboard. A board you attach papers to so you write on them as you walk around.

Catherine
Well, Dan, it's time for us to go and get some exercise. Join us again next time and remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, bye.

Dan
Bye!

Now Dan, would you say you had a sedentary lifestyle at all?
现在 Dan，你会说你有久坐不动的生活方式吗？

Dan(担)
If I only went to work, yes, I would have a pretty sedentary life. I sit on the tube, I sit at my desk or in the studio for most of the day. But because I know that's not good for my health, I do also like to go to the gym a couple of times a week and I'll do some exercise, like a bike ride or playing football at the weekend. So, my job is pretty sedentary, but not my life.
如果我只去工作，是的，我会过上久坐不动的生活。我坐在管子上，一天中的大部分时间都坐在我的办公桌前或工作室里。但因为我知道这对我的健康不利，所以我也喜欢每周去几次健身房，我会做一些运动，比如骑自行车或在周末踢足球。所以，我的工作是久坐不动的，但不是我的生活。

Catherine(凯瑟 琳)
Nice answer, Dan. And our topic today is about how one country in particular has been very successful in dealing with the problem of a sedentary population. But before we find out more, here is today's question. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours? So, Dan, what do you think?
“回答得不错，丹。我们今天的主题是关于一个国家如何在处理久坐不动的人口问题方面非常成功。但在我们了解更多信息之前，这里有一个今天的问题。根据最近的一项调查，英国人平均每天坐下多长时间？是：a） 6 到 7 小时之间；b） 7 到 8 小时之间或 c） 8 到 9 小时之间？那么，Dan，你怎么看？

Dan(担)
Based on my day, it would be between 8 and 9 hours, but I don't know if I am an average person! So I'm interested to learn the answer for myself.
根据我的一天，这将在 8 到 9 小时之间，但我不知道我是否是一个普通人！所以我很想自己了解答案。

Catherine(凯瑟 琳)
We'll find out the answer later in the programme. Now, 40 years ago Finland was perhaps the unhealthiest country in the Western world. But now, it's one of the healthiest.
我们稍后会在节目中找到答案。现在，40 年前，芬兰可能是西方世界最不健康的国家。但现在，它是最健康的疫苗之一。

Dan(担)
Death by heart disease in Finland has fallen by 80% and life expectancy, the age at which the average person lives until, has risen by 10 years.
芬兰的心脏病死亡率下降了 80%，预期寿命延长了 10 年。

Catherine(凯瑟 琳)
How has this been achieved? This was investigated on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme and one of the ways Finland has improved the health of the nation is by a lot of state involvement. BBC reporter John Laurenson describes in a humorous way how this works. How does he describe someone with many health problems?
这是如何实现的？BBC Radio 4 的 You and Yours 节目对此进行了调查，芬兰改善国家健康的方式之一是通过大量的国家参与。BBC 记者约翰·劳伦森 以幽默的方式描述了这是如何运作的。他如何描述一个有很多健康问题的人？

John Laurenson(约翰·劳伦森)
If you're an exercise shirker because you're fat or old or asthmatic or chained to your computer or just plain lazy or all of those things rolled into one super-health disaster zone, they will come to you in the form perhaps, of a stern lady with a clipboard and make some firm suggestions. They won't actually drag you off your PlayStation, out of your nursing home or out of the pub but they do get quite close.
如果你因为肥胖、年老、哮喘、被锁在电脑前、或者只是懒惰或所有这些事情都归入一个超级健康重灾区而成为运动推卸者，他们可能会以一位拿着写字板的严厉女士的形式来找你，并提出一些坚定的建议。他们实际上不会把你从 PlayStation 上拖下来，拖出你的疗养院或酒吧，但他们确实非常接近。

Catherine(凯瑟 琳)
How did he describe someone with a lot of health problems, Dan?
丹，他是如何描述一个有很多健康问题的人的？

Dan(担)

嗯，他不是很恭维，我们应该强调，这份报告相当半开玩笑，这意味着它本来就是为了搞笑，不应该被认真对待，但他称有很多健康问题的人为“超级健康灾难区”。

'Super-health disaster zones'. So what other vocabulary can we pick from what he said?
“超级健康灾区”。那么，我们还可以从他所说的内容中挑选出哪些其他词汇呢？

And in his description the reporter says that this stern lady will have a clipboard. It's a hard board you can attach papers to so you can write on the paper while you are moving around.
Stern 是一个形容词，意思是非常严肃和严格，一个没有幽默感的人可能会很生气。在他的描述中，记者说这位严厉的女士将有一个剪贴板。这是一块硬板，您可以在上面贴上纸张，这样您就可以在四处走动时在纸上写字。

Catherine(凯瑟 琳)
