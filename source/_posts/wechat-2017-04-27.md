### 【英文脚本】
Dan
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I'm Dan.
 
Neil
And I’m Neil. In this episode we’ll be discussing miraculous survivals.
 
Dan
Have you ever had a near-death experience, Neil?
 
Neil
A near-death experience, meaning a situation where I very nearly died? Well, I once fell off the side of a mountain, but I was saved by a tree.
 
Dan
That’s incredible!
 
Neil
Why do you ask?
 
Dan
Well, I recently heard a story about Alcides Moreno.
 
Neil
Who’s that?
 
Dan
He’s a window cleaner. He cleaned the windows on the sky scrapers in New York. Except one day, he fell.
 
Neil
Oh my goodness.
 
Dan
Yes. And what’s more is. He survived.
 
Neil
Wow! How far did he fall?
 
Dan
Ah, well, all will be revealed after this week’s question. According to the BBC, what chance of survival does a human have when falling to the ground from around 3 storeys? a) 30% b) 50% c) 70%
 
Neil
And by storeys, you mean the entire floor of a building including all its rooms. Well, I think it’s got to be b) 50%
 
Dan
Well, we’ll find out if you’re right or not later. So, do you want to hear the story?
 
Neil
Of course!
 
Dan
Well, on the 7th of December, Ecuadorians Alcides Moreno, and his brother, Edgar, went up to the top of the Solow Tower in New York to clean the windows like they did every day.
 
Neil
And how tall is that building?
 
Dan
It’s 47 storeys.
 
Neil
And how did they usually clean it?
 
Dan
Well, they used a scaffold, which is a structure of interconnected pipes and boards that creates a frame or shape
 
Neil
Ah, so in this case there was a platform which was attached by cables, or large metal ropes, and hung over the edge of the building and which the window cleaners could raise and lower.
 
Dan
Exactly. So, as usual they filled up their buckets and climbed on to the scaffold.
 
Neil
And.
 
Dan
Well, unfortunately the cables were loose, and the scaffold fell from the building. Both brothers fell 47 storeys.
 
Neil
That’s terrible! What happened next?
 
Dan
I’ll let Jo Fidgen, presenter of the BBC show Outlook, explain
 
Jo Fidgen – BBC Outlook presenter
When firefighters arrived on the scene, they found a crowd of distraught onlookers pointing towards an alleyway. Edgar had landed on a fence and couldn’t be helped, but Alcides was found crouching in a pile of twisted metal still clutching the controls of the scaffold. He was breathing.even trying to stand up.
 
Neil
So, firefighters arrived to find a group of distraught, which means extremely worried and upset, people showing them where the two men had come down.
 
Dan
Yes, and though, unfortunately, Edgar didn’t survive, Alcides was found clutching, or holding extremely tightly, to the controls of the scaffold.
 
Neil
Did I hear correctly that he was trying to stand up? Did he escape the accident unscathed?
 
Dan
Unscathed means without any injury at all. And, no, he fell into a coma for 3 weeks and needed 24 pints of blood.
 
Neil
I’m speechless. I don’t understand how he lived.
 
Dan
You aren’t the only one. Listen to what Dr. Philip Barie, from New York-Presbyterian Hospital, said about the whole incident.
 
Philip Barie, New York-Presbyterian Hospital
I don’t know what adjective you’d care to use: unprecedented, extraordinary. if you are a believer in miracles, this would be one.
 
Neil
Wow. So he can’t explain it either. He said it was unprecedented which means never happened or done before.
 
Dan
Yes, and he also said that this was a miracle, which is an unexplainable positive outcome to a bad situation that people say was the intervention of a god.
 
Neil
I guess we’ll never know. But one thing I can know is the answer to this week’s question.
 
Dan
Ah, yes. I asked you what chance of survival does a human have when falling to the ground from around 3 storeys? a) 30% b) 50% c) 70%
 
Neil
And I said b) 50%
 
Dan
And you were exactly right. Well done.
 
Neil
Wow! It’s a first!
 
Dan
Shall we look at the vocabulary then?
 
Neil
First we had a near-death experience, which is an experience where a person very nearly, or could easily have died. Have you ever had one, Dan?
 
Dan
When I was 14 I fell out of a canoe into a river and got stuck between the boat and a rock with my head underwater. I thought it was the end. But, some people pulled me out. Then we had scaffold. A scaffold is a structure of interconnected pipes and boards that creates a frame or shape. Name a place that you might see scaffolding, Neil.
 
Neil
They are usually put up around houses when builders are working on the roof. Then we had clutching. If you clutch something, it means you hold it extremely tightly. There is a well-known idiom that uses this word. Sound familiar, Dan?
 
Dan
Ah, you’re clutching at straws, Neil, which means you are trying to find a reason or hope to succeed when it’s extremely unlikely. What was after that?
 
Neil
After that we had unscathed. If you are unscathed, you are uninjured. We often talk about escaping something unscathed. Have you ever escaped an accident unscathed?
 
Dan
Well, when I was 6, I fell through a hole that some builders had made while doing rennovation. I hit the ground in the garage, but somehow I escaped unscathed. Maybe, I bounced? Then we heard unprecedented. If something is unprecedented, it has never happened or been done before. Can you think of an example, Neil?
 
Neil
Neil Armstrong walking on the moon was unprecedented in 1969. And, finally, we had miracle. A miracle is an unexplainable positive outcome to a bad situation that people say was the intervention of a god. The adjectives is miraculous. Do you believe in miracles, Dan?
 
Dan
Well, I’ve never seen or experienced one, but when you hear a story like this, it’s difficult not to. And, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!
 
Neil
And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there.
 
Both
Bye!

First we had a near-death experience, which is an experience where a person very nearly, or could easily have died. Have you ever had one, Dan?
首先，我们有一个濒死体验，这是一个人非常接近或可能很容易死亡的经历。你有过吗，丹？

Dan(担)
When I was 14 I fell out of a canoe into a river and got stuck between the boat and a rock with my head underwater. I thought it was the end. But, some people pulled me out. Then we had scaffold. A scaffold is a structure of interconnected pipes and boards that creates a frame or shape. Name a place that you might see scaffolding, Neil.
当我 14 岁时，我从独木舟上掉进了一条河里，被卡在船和一块岩石之间，头在水下。我以为这就是结局。但是，有些人把我拉了出来。然后我们有了脚手架。脚手架是由互连的管道和板组成的结构，用于创建框架或形状。说出一个你可能会看到脚手架的地方，Neil。

Neil(尼尔)
They are usually put up around houses when builders are working on the roof. Then we had clutching. If you clutch something, it means you hold it extremely tightly. There is a well-known idiom that uses this word. Sound familiar, Dan?
当建筑商在屋顶上工作时，它们通常被放在房屋周围。然后我们紧紧抓住。如果你紧紧抓住什么东西，那就意味着你把它握得非常紧。有一个众所周知的谚语使用这个词。听起来很熟悉，Dan？

Ah, you’re clutching at straws, Neil, which means you are trying to find a reason or hope to succeed when it’s extremely unlikely. What was after that?
啊，你抓着稻草，尼尔，这意味着你正在努力寻找成功的理由或希望，而这几乎是不可能的。那之后是什么？

Neil(尼尔)
After that we had unscathed. If you are unscathed, you are uninjured. We often talk about escaping something unscathed. Have you ever escaped an accident unscathed?
在那之后，我们就毫发无损了。如果你没有受伤，你就不会受伤。我们经常谈论毫发无损地逃离某物。你有没有安然无恙地逃脱事故？

Dan(担)
Well, when I was 6, I fell through a hole that some builders had made while doing rennovation. I hit the ground in the garage, but somehow I escaped unscathed. Maybe, I bounced? Then we heard unprecedented. If something is unprecedented, it has never happened or been done before. Can you think of an example, Neil?
好吧，当我 6 岁时，我掉进了一些建筑商在进行翻新时挖的一个洞。我在车库里撞到了地，但不知何故我毫发无损地逃脱了。也许，我反弹了？然后我们听到了前所未有的声音。如果某件事是前所未有的，那么它以前从未发生过或做过。Neil，你能想出一个例子吗？

Neil(尼尔)
Neil Armstrong walking on the moon was unprecedented in 1969. And, finally, we had miracle. A miracle is an unexplainable positive outcome to a bad situation that people say was the intervention of a god. The adjectives is miraculous. Do you believe in miracles, Dan?
尼尔·阿姆斯特朗 （Neil Armstrong） 在 1969 年在月球上行走是前所未有的。最后，我们创造了奇迹。奇迹是人们说是上帝的干预所造成的糟糕情况的无法解释的积极结果。这些形容词是奇迹。丹，你相信奇迹吗？
