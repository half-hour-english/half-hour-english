### 【英文脚本】
Neil
Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

Beth
And I'm Beth.

Neil
Lots of things can make us feel embarrassed – that self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red and you wish you could just disappear.

Beth
Have you had any embarrassing moments, Neil?

Neil
Yes, many. Once I met my parents in a car park and I saw them arriving in their car and I waved my hands around in a very silly way. But unfortunately, I soon discovered that it wasn't my parents. It was another couple.

Beth
Oh no, that's really embarrassing. I remember answering the phone, I thought it was my best friend and I said 'hello' in a very silly voice, and then they asked to speak to my dad, and it wasn't my friend.

Neil
What was the voice?

Beth
Hello?

Neil
Oh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing. When it comes to our health, there's no end of things to be embarrassed about.

Beth
Yes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences.

Neil
In this programme we'll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we'll be learning some useful new words and phrases.

Beth
So, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK's Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ?

Neil
So I think it's probably a lot. So c) 61%.

Beth
OK. We will find out if that's correct at the end of the programme.

As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if the
difference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here's Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:

Dr Vanessa Apea
So they'll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you'll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what's happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it's delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really.

Neil
Many people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination.

Beth
For some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends.

Neil
There are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:

James Gallagher
Can you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease?

Dr Vanessa Apea
I bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I'm going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues.

Beth
James asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone.

Neil
As well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively, Dr Apea also uses non- verbal cues - the expression on her face, her hand movements, and the tone of her voice, rather than words, to communicate and relax the patient. Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn't it time to reveal the answer to your question?

Beth
It is. I asked you: What percentage of people said they had delayed visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed, but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition? Do you remember what you said, Neil?

Neil
Yes, I think I said c) 61%.

Beth
I'm afraid that is not the correct answer. It was, in fact a) 21% or just over a fifth. OK, let’s recap the new vocabulary we've used, starting with delay, to postpone or put off until a later time.

Neil
To diagnose a disease or medical condition means to identify it by recognising the symptoms and examining the patient.

Beth
If you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle with painful feelings without asking someone for help.

Neil
The phrasal verb put someone at ease means to make someone feel calm and relaxed.

Beth
The adjective confidential means kept private and secret and describes information which is not shared with anyone else.

Neil
And finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice, rather than speech, to show your feelings. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not built your vocabulary and listening skills even more with the quiz and worksheet related to this programme? They’re both available now on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. See you there!

Beth
Bye!

Neil(尼尔)
Lots of things can make us feel embarrassed – that self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red and you wish you could just disappear.

Beth(贝丝)
Have you had any embarrassing moments, Neil?
你有没有经历过尴尬的时刻，尼尔？

Beth(贝丝)
Yes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences.
是的，有些人感到非常尴尬，以至于他们没有在应该去看医生的时候去看医生，有时会带来严重的后果。

Neil(尼尔)
In this programme we'll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we'll be learning some useful new words and phrases.
在这个节目中，我们将讨论医疗尴尬的问题，像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语。

Beth(贝丝)
So, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK's Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ?
所以，我有一个问题。Neil，据英国《护理时报》报道，有多少百分比的受访者表示他们因尴尬而推迟了去看医生，后来又被诊断出患有健康状况？是：a） 21% ？b） 41% ？或者，c） 61% ？

Neil(尼尔)
So I think it's probably a lot. So c) 61%.
所以我认为这可能很多。所以 c） 61%。

Beth(贝丝)
OK. We will find out if that's correct at the end of the programme.
还行。我们将在节目结束时找出这是否正确。

As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if the(作为人类，如果我们觉得自己与他人不同，我们会感到尴尬，尤其是当)
difference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here's Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:
差异是物理的。但是，对医疗状况感到尴尬如何影响我们与医生的关系呢？以下是伦敦巴茨医院性健康顾问 Vanessa Apea 博士对 BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的更多解释：

Dr Vanessa Apea(Vanessa Apea 医师)
So they'll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you'll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what's happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it's delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really.
因此，他们会延迟进入诊所和寻求治疗，因此你经常会看到一些人，他们本来可以更早地被诊断出患有正在发生的事情，并且可能更早地接受了干预，但延迟了相当多。所以我觉得我们看到很多人真的在默默地忍受痛苦。

Neil(尼尔)
Many people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination.
许多人延迟去看医生 —— 他们推迟去看医生或推迟到以后。因此，他们的问题没有得到诊断。To diagnose 是指通过医学检查来识别疾病或健康问题。

Beth(贝丝)
For some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends.
对一些人来说，尴尬的感觉是如此强烈，他们宁愿默默忍受 —— 在不寻求帮助的情况下与痛苦作斗争 —— 也不愿去看医生。但幸运的是，您可以做一些事情来提供帮助。写下你的问题，和朋友一起去，去看你信任的医生是 Apea 医生推荐的一些想法。

Neil(尼尔)
There are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:

I bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I'm going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues.
我为对话带来透明度，并拥有它，并说我将问你一些非常私人的问题，也可能有亲密的检查......我想向你保证，这是保密的，这是一个安全、不带评判的空间......所以说真的，我也经常说出创造那个空间的词。我希望，也要以我的方式，以及我的非语言暗示。

Beth(贝丝)
James asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone.

Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn't it time to reveal the answer to your question?
除了敏感地讨论令人尴尬的问题外，Apea 医生还使用非语言暗示 - 她脸上的表情、她的手部动作和她的语气，而不是语言，来与患者交流和放松。尴尬是正常的，在支持下，希望我们中的更多人会感到放心去看医生。好的，贝丝，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？
